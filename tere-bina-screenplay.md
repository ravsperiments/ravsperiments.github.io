# Tere Bina: Screenplay within a Song
_February 24, 2026_

In the movie Guru, the song “Tere Bina” comes right after the first conflict between Gurukant and Sujatha following their marriage. What follows is a familiar Indian-cinema trope: using a song to stage romantic quarrel and reconciliation. But this song is interesting in its structure. It plays out like a small screenplay embedded inside the film’s screenplay. The film was also dubbed in Tamil, which gives us a direct comparison between the interplay of A. R. Rahman and Gulzar in Hindi, and Rahman with Vairamuthu in Tamil. This creates a clean lens to examine two things: how Rahman structures the emotional arc through music, and how each lyricist works within that structure to shape the reconciliation.

The song starts with the familiar chorus and moves into Stanza 1, fully sung by Rahman, setting the stage and the mood. The chorus returns, and the first interlude follows — again dominated by the male voice, with Rahman singing long alaapanas while the instruments take a back seat, almost like repeated and increasingly desperate attempts to reconcile. Toward the end of this interlude, Chinmayi enters with a soft “ooo” — the classic Indian melodic hum — marking the first crack in the woman’s defense, though the tone is still melancholic.

This flows into Stanza 2, once more fully carried by Rahman and joined by the chorus. After this comes an almost silent instrumental interlude, as if the man has exhausted himself and falls quiet. Chinmayi chimes in again with “ooo,” but this time she starts the third stanza followed by Rahman, almost like a dialogue, as if the reconciliation is finally starting to happen. This is then immediately followed by a repeat of Stanza 1, with female and male voices interleaved, indicating the completion of the romantic quarrel.

Across the song, the interludes steadily shorten in length. The first interlude is the longest, but once the first crack appears, each subsequent pause becomes briefer, as if the emotional distance is steadily reducing. Visually, this shift perhaps also coincides with Gurukant deciding to go to her — even though this decision isn’t explicitly shown — reducing their physical distance in parallel with the shrinking interludes. By the time Stanza 3 ends, there is no pause at all before the final return of Stanza 1. This is mirrored on screen when she immediately embraces him on arrival, almost as if questioning why it took so long in the first place.

Vairamuthu mirrors this structure in his lyrics very closely. Even though I’m not particularly fond of how some of the words sound — for example lines like “aasai thaavudhi un mele” and “nee illaadha rathiriyo” — and personally prefer the Hindi version, the emotional progression itself is handled very deliberately. After the male voice speaks about his suffering without her, the woman’s stanza doesn’t move straight into reconciliation. She is still hurt. She pushes back. She asks whether what he did was fair — “Roja poovai mul kaayam seithaal nyaayamaa” — and whether words alone can really resolve this quarrel — “pesi pesi en udal enna theerumaa.”

I can’t say for sure whether this structure — and the way the lyrics mirror it — was intentional. It doesn’t feel like something that was carefully planned and discussed. It feels more intuitive, like two creators working in resonance. The clue comes from the Hindi version. Gulzar, after the male voice exhausts his case, moves directly into reconciliation in Stanza 3. In contrast, in the Tamil version, the woman doesn’t immediately soften once the man finishes expressing regret. Her wounds don’t heal instantly. She still has things to say, and she says them. Only after that emotional release does the reconciliation begin.

This is where it gets tricky to choose between the two — while I prefer how the Hindi words sound, the Tamil version ends up working better for me emotionally. One thing that didn’t work for me was the staging of the visuals. The montage of reconciliation intercut with Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai dancing on constructed sets never really connected for me. In a film that otherwise has some of the most creatively staged songs — especially Ek Lo Ek Muft — this felt like a rare letdown.
